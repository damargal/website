<!-- From my beginnings as a PhD student I have felt attracted to the use of genetic tools to carry out my research, which has been focused on the study of coevolutionary interactions between avian brood parasites and their hosts. I have performed made sojourns for study purposes in two universities abroad: the University of Sheffield (UK) and the Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris (France), where I could learn and then to use some genetic techniques, mainly related to microsatellites. I have used these loci to estimate genetic differences both among individuals and among populations. However, I have been particularly interested by the use of genetic tools to study the functional genetic variation underpinning the individual traits and behaviours and how this variation has been shaped by the natural selection. In this sense, my investigation has focused on the study of the genetic basis of a defensive behaviour that some avian species do, i.e. recognition and ejection from their nests of brood parasite eggs and using as study specie magpies (Pica pica) and their brood parasite, great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius). During my two post-doc projects (2006-2008, University of Sheffield, Prof. T.A. Burke) (2009-2012, EEZA-CSIC, Prof. JJ.Soler), I aimed to further study host defences at the genetic level by extending the previous analysis to other magpie populations that suffer different levels of parasitism across Europe.  -->



<!-- In 2013, I decided to start a proper training in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in order to take full advantage when analyzing and interpreting the information generated by the new high-throughout techniques, such as NGS. During the 10th edition of the Master in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, I was skilled in the basic procedures used currently in these topics through theoretical and practical sessions. I performed my Master thesis project in the Ensembl team at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI, Hinxton, UK), whose goal was to use an assembly-based variation discovery algorithm to discover as many locations of heterozygous variation in several of the Ensembl support specvies. From October 2013, I am a member of research group of Paul Flicek at EMBL-EBI working on the integration of mosaic structure of haplotypes and genomic regulation data to find genomic regions responsible for strain specific phenotypes in Rat.  -->

<!--     Next to genetic-related projects I have also been involved in other evolutionary behavioural ecology studies. These projects deal with (i) parent-offspring conflicts (nestling begging behaviour and parental investment); (ii) nests, ectoparasites and bacteria (multi-level approach to the study of adaptations to breed in parasitic risky environments); and (iii) environmental factors affecting the recognition and rejection behaviour of foreign eggs. In all these studies, I helped with the development of experimental designs, carried out and supervised fieldwork (natural populations of magpies and spotless starlings Sturnus unicolor and a captive population of house sparrows Passer domesticus), and participated in statistical analysis and publications.  -->

<!--     My main future goal is to merge my experience on Evolutionary biology and Behavioral ecology with the knowledge I am acquiring on Comparative and Evolutionary Genomics in a new research line on Ecological genomics, which is a topic with a great potential.  -->
